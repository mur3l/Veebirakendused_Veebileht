            The History of Pashley Cycles
        </p>
        <p>
            Pashley Cycles, the longest-established British bicycle manufacturer, has a rich history that dates back to 1926. The company was founded by William Rathbone 'Rath' Pashley in New John Street West, Birmingham. Rath Pashley, who had been apprenticed to the Austin Motor Company before the First World War and served as a dispatch rider during the war, used his engineering knowledge and passion for two-wheeled transport to establish Pashley and Barber.
        </p>
        <img src="/images/pashley_cycles/Pashley1.webp" alt="Pashley1" width="50%" height="25%">
        <p>
            In its early years, Pashley and Barber declared themselves as "Manufacturers of every type of cycle," producing a range of models including everyday roadsters, clubman's racing machines, tradesman's carrier cycles, and the famous Pashley tandem2. However, competition in the cycle trade was fierce, and Rath Pashley soon realized that success would come through identifying a market niche. This led to the formation of Pashley Carrier Cycles, which focused on building tough carrier cycles designed to withstand the abuse thrown at them by errand boys.
        </p>
        <p>
            In 1936, the company was incorporated as W. R. Pashley Ltd. and moved to a spacious new factory in Chester Street, Aston. The company increasingly focused on delivery and vending tricycles for dairy products, ice cream, and general deliveries2. During the Second World War, Pashley turned some of its production capacity over to aid the war effort, producing military equipment such as Browning machine gun mounts and coach-building ambulances.
        </p>

        <p>
            Following the war, Pashley continued to produce carrier cycles and larger tricycles, and even ventured into the manufacture of motor rickshaws and Brockhouse Indian Motor Tricycles. The company remained committed to hand-building high-quality bicycles and tricycles, maintaining a strong connection to its heritage of craftsmanship and innovation.
        </p>
        <p>
            Today, Pashley Cycles is based in Stratford-upon-Avon and continues to produce a wide range of bicycles, tricycles, and commercial carrier and cargo cycles2. The company has not bowed to the pressure to shift to cheaper overseas manufacture and remains dedicated to UK production and craftsmanship. Pashley employs a close-knit team of experienced craftsmen who hand-build each cycle individually, ensuring an unparalleled level of quality and longevity.
        </p>

        <p>
            Pashley's commitment to innovation and customer satisfaction has led to the development of new products that combine traditional elegance with contemporary ideas. The company continues to evolve while staying true to its historical identity, producing bicycles that are "different by design... distinctive by nature".
        </p>
        <p>
            With nearly 100 years of knowledge, heritage, and experience, Pashley Cycles remains a unique and cherished British manufacturer, providing bicycles that offer years of performance, pleasure, and reliability.
